# üÖøÔ∏è Parking Lot & Ticket Service (Microservices Demo)

## üìå Overview  
This project demonstrates **two Spring Boot microservices** communicating with each other:  

‚úÖ **Parking Lot Service** ‚Äì manages parking spots  
‚úÖ **Ticket Service** ‚Äì manages vehicle entry/exit tickets  

They are containerized with **Docker** and orchestrated using **Docker Compose**.

## üöÄ How It Works  

1. **Ticket Service** receives a **vehicle entry request**  
2. It calls **Parking Lot Service** to get the **first available spot**  
3. It **occupies the spot** and creates a ticket  
4. On vehicle exit, **Ticket Service** calls Parking Lot Service to **free the spot**  
5. Ticket is marked as completed

## üê≥ Running the Project  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Build JAR files  

```bash
cd parking-lot-service
mvn clean package -DskipTests

cd ../ticket-service
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start services with Docker  

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

- Parking Lot Service ‚Üí `http://localhost:8080`  
- Ticket Service ‚Üí `http://localhost:8081`  

Stop containers:  
```bash
docker-compose down
```
